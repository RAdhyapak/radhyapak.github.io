			I was born in the city of Guwahati in India. It was back in 2001, when I first crossed paths with a personal computer.
			My father bought these set of boxes that were connected by wires with a screen on one of them,
			where you could draw with virtual paint and play games like solitaire and minesweeper. After using it for a few days,
			I no longer had to fight with my brother for the control of the television. I had found something else to dig 
			my head in. I soon got hold of a Britannica Encyclopedia CD, and played the quiz game over and over, so many times that I
			knew the answers even before reading the questions. Soon enough I got introduced to the programming language of Java as
			part of the school curriculum and all I used to wonder is, how simple instructions that we were writing in Java could be
			actually used to create complex softwares that I used to run on my computer back home. At the time, it seemed improbable.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the increasing love of computers, I moved to Vellore to pursue Bachelors in Computer Science. Motivated with the zeal
			to learn about the craft of software making, I dug deeply into everything I learnt and gradutated with the degree of B.Tech
			in Computer Science.

			I live in Sandy Springs, Atlanta, Georgia and am currently working as a Software Engineer at SimCorp.

			I had got placed into one of the biggest companies in travel technology and got the opportunity to undergo internship during
			last semester of my college. During this period I simultanepusly worked on my final year project. My project guide had recently
			started working on initiatives in the smart city mission, which is a push by the Government of India to modernise cities across
			India. Hence, I decided to make a 'Smart Mirror' as my final year project. Here is video of the prototype that I made:
